It has been written to have a modular structure that can be easily modified or added to at any level. It is also designed to itself be a component of larger model.\n\nIt aims to provide a comprehensive yet minimalist set of photosynthesis and leaf energy balance models, eventually including as many as possible published photosynthesis formulations. But nothing else. Growth models, 3D canopy models, nutrient uptake etc. can be supplied from another package.\n\nIncluded formulations of the basic FvCB model include Ball-Berry (and multiple sub-variants), EMAX, Tuzet, and Jarvis formulations.\n\nThese are written out in interchangeable components: you can write you own components in a script and swap them into the model - for any part of this package. You Just need to define the struct for parameters, and define the corresponding method for the formulation you with to write.\n\nThis means the old problem of multiple forks with minor formulation changes is essentially solved. Never edit the source code of this package, just define new alternate components with your desired changes.\n\nExample\n\nHere we will define a basic Ball-Berry model, and run it:\n\nparams = FvCBEnergyBalance(\n    photosynthesis_model=FvCBPhotosynthesis(\n        stomatal_conductance=BallBerryStomatalConductance(\n            gs_submodel=BallBerryStomatalConductance(),\n            soil_model=NoSoilMethod()\n        ),\n        flux_model=DukeFlux(),\n        compensation_model=BadgerCollatzCompensation()\n    )\n)\nvars = BallBerryVars()\n\nenbal!(vars, params)\n\nFormulations using the MAESPA energy balance and FvCB photosynthesis,  all tested against MAESPA:\n\nBallBerry stomatal conducance types:\nBallBerry\nMedlyn\nLeuning\nEmax\n\nOther formulations, working but not tested\n\nTuzet : PSILFIND is not yet tested against MAESPA. Use with caution.\nJarvis : Not tested against Maestra, also use with caution.\n\nNotice we run enbal! not photosynthesis!, as enbal! runs photosynthesis! in a loop to calculate both the temperature and the assimilated C.\n\nNotes about strategies used in this package\n\nThis package was intentionally written as an exploration of how process model components could generally be structured in better ways to traditional models - to reduce the overheads of making small changes to any part of the model and improve the potential for collaboration. This method also facilitates composing formulations from multiple packages into new models without having to change the codebases.\n\nUnits\n\nThis implementation takes advantage of Unitful.jl to provide unit checking and conversion. This removes the possibility of a large class of errors, especially when adding your own custom formulations, and has little or no runtime cost in most cases.\n\nNested parameters\n\nParameters are composed of nested structs, so that components can be modified and new components can be added without altering the original. This structure should be liberating for those wanting to make modifications to existing formulations, and to share them.\n\nFormulations all follow the pattern of defining an abstract type and a function at the top of the file. All formulation variants inherit from the abstract type, and define a method of the function.\n\nThis allows easy addition of any model components without altering the package code.\n\nTo convert model parameters to a vector for optimisation or interactive interfaces, Flatten.jl can be used.\n\nFieldMetadata.jl allows adding other metadata to parameters (all the | XX | in struct definitions), such as descriptions, defaults, units and bounds. These can also be flattened with Flatten.jl for used in an optimiser or interface without writing any custom code.\n\nOther tools like the (unpublished) Codify.jl turns a nested model struct into the code for keyword argument constructors that would build it. \n\nIssues\n\nTests\n\nCurrently this package has no real tests, as there were none for the original Fortran. Instead it tests against the original formulations. Many of these test pass. But Tuzet, Jarvis, and EMAX models are as yet untested.\n\nWhile very few photosynthesis models actually have tests, we should work towards Photosynthesis.jl being properly tested so that we know that formulations do what we intend them to.\n\nNon-functional variables struct\n\nTemp variables are written directly to a variables struct. This could be replaced with a functional style where variables are rebuilt and explicitly updated. This would mean that the package can be used on GPUs, and so the updating of state flow is easier to follow.\n\nCredits\n\nThanks got to the creators of the Maestra Fortran libraries including Belinda Medlyn and Remko Duursma, and all earlier contributors to Maestra and Maestro.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Energy-balance-model","page":"Home","title":"Energy balance model","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Photosynthesis.AbstractEnergyBalance\nPhotosynthesis.AbstractMaespaEnergyBalance\nMaespaEnergyBalance\nenbal!\nPhotosynthesis.enbal_init!","category":"page"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.AbstractEnergyBalance","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.AbstractEnergyBalance","text":"Energy balance models calculate leaf temperature, usually also running  photosynthesis and all other model components along with environmental models like radiation and boundary layer conductance.\n\nThey are run in enbal! methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.AbstractMaespaEnergyBalance","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.AbstractMaespaEnergyBalance","text":"Energy balance models derived from MAESPA/MAESTRA models.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.MaespaEnergyBalance","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.MaespaEnergyBalance","text":"MaespaEnergyBalance(radiation_conductance, \n                  boundary_conductance, \n                  decoupling, \n                  evapotranspiration, \n                  photosynthesis, \n                  max_iterations)\n\nEnergy-balance model composed of submodels from radiation conductance,  boundary conductance, decoupling, evapotranspiration photosynthesis.\n\nmax_iterations determines the maximum number of iterations to perform to determine  flux and temperature.\n\nField Default Units Description\nradiationconductancemodel WangRadiationConductance{Float64}(1.0, 1  Radiation condutance model\nboundaryconductancemodel BoundaryConductance{Quantity{Float64,𝐋,U  Boundary conductance model\ndecoupling_model McNaughtonJarvisDecoupling()  \nevapotranspiration_model PenmanMonteithEvapotranspiration()  Evapotranspiration model\nphotosynthesis_model FvCBPhotosynthesis{Flux{Jmax{Quantity{Fl  Photosynthesis model\nmax_iterations 100  Number of iterations used to find leaf temperature\natol 0.02 K  Tolerance for difference with previous leaf temperature\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.enbal!","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.enbal!","text":"enbal!(v, m::AbstractEnergyBalance)\n\nCalculates leaf photosynthesis and transpiration for an  AbstractEnergyBalance model m and variables v.\n\nResults are written to v.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Biophysical-components","page":"Home","title":"Biophysical components","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Photosynthesis.saturated_vapour_pressure\nPhotosynthesis.vapour_pressure_deficit\nPhotosynthesis.latent_heat_water_vapour\nPhotosynthesis.arrhenius\nPhotosynthesis.leaftemp","category":"page"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.saturated_vapour_pressure","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.saturated_vapour_pressure","text":"saturated_vapour_pressure(tair)\n\nCalculate saturated water vapour pressure in u\"Pa\"  at air temperature tair in u\"K\".\n\nFrom Jones 1992 p 110 (note error in a -
