It has been written to have a modular structure that can be easily modified or added to at any level. It is also designed to itself be a component of larger model.\n\nIt aims to provide a comprehensive yet minimalist set of photosynthesis and leaf energy balance models, eventually including as many as possible published photosynthesis formulations: but nothing else. Growth models, 3D canopy models, nutrient uptake etc. should be supplied from another package.\n\nIncluded formulations of the basic FvCB model include Ball-Berry (and multiple sub-variants), EMAX, Tuzet, and Jarvis.\n\nExample\n\nHere we will define a basic Ball-Berry model, and run it:\n\nparams = FvCBEnergyBalance(\n    photosynthesis_model=FvCBPhotosynthesis(\n        stomatal_conductance=BallBerryStomatalConductance(\n            gs_submodel=BallBerryStomatalConductance(),\n            soil_model=NoSoilMethod()\n        ),\n        flux_model=DukeFlux(),\n        compensation_model=BadgerCollatzCompensation()\n    )\n)\nvars = BallBerryVars()\n\nenbal!(vars, params)\n\nNotice we run enbal! not photosynthesis!, as enbal! runs photosynthesis! in a loop to calculate both the temperature and the assimilated C.\n\nNotes about strategies used in this package\n\nThis package was intentionally written as an exploration of how process model components could generally be structured in better ways to traditional models - to reduce the overheads of making small changes to any part of the model and improve the potential for collaboration. This method also facilitates composing formulations from multiple packages into new models without having to change the codebases. Some of the structural ideas seem promising, others may need rethinking.\n\nUnits\n\nThis implementation takes advantage of Unitful.jl to provide unit checking and conversion. This removes the possibility of a large class of errors, especially when adding your own custom formulations, and has little or no runtime cost in most cases\n\nNested parameters\n\nParameters are composed of nested structs, so that components can be modified and new components can be added without altering the original. This structure should be liberating for those wanting to make modifications to existing formulations.\n\nFormulations all follow the pattern of defining an abstract type and a function at the top of the file. All formulation variants inherit from the abstract type, and define a method of the function.\n\nThis allows easy addition of any model components without altering the package code.\n\nTo convert model parameters to a vector for optimisation or interactive interfaces, Flatten.jl can be used.\n\nFieldMetadata.jl allows adding other metadata to parameters (all the | XX | in struct definitions), such as descriptions, defaults, units and bounds. These can also be flattened with Flatten.jl for used in an optimiser or interface without writing any custom code.\n\nOther tools like the (unpublished) Codify.jl turns a nested model struct into the code for kwarg constructors that would build it. \n\nIssues\n\nTests\n\nCurrently this package has no real tests, as there were none for the original Fortran. Instead it tests against the original formulations. Many of these test pass, but some still don't.\n\nObviously this situation needs to change. Unit tests and comprehensive integration tests are required. But is a significant amount of work and it would need a more specific application and larger user base to be justifiable.\n\nNon-functional variable struct\n\nTemp variables are written directly to a variables struct. This should be replaced with a functional style where variables are rebuilt and explicitly updated. This would mean that the package can be used on GPUs, and so the updating of state flow is easier to follow.\n\nCredits\n\nThanks got to the creators of the Maestra Fortran libraries including Belinda Medlyn and Remko Duursma, and all earlier contributors to Maestra and Maestro.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Energy-balance-model","page":"Home","title":"Energy balance model","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Photosynthesis.AbstractEnergyBalance\nPhotosynthesis.AbstractFvCBEnergyBalance\nFvCBEnergyBalance\nenbal!\nPhotosynthesis.enbal_init!\nPhotosynthesis.enbal_update!","category":"page"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.AbstractEnergyBalance","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.AbstractEnergyBalance","text":"Energy balance models\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.AbstractFvCBEnergyBalance","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.AbstractFvCBEnergyBalance","text":"Energy balance models based on genral FvCB photosynthesis, derived from Maespa/Maestra models.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.FvCBEnergyBalance","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.FvCBEnergyBalance","text":"FvCBEnergyBalance(radiation_conductance, \n                  boundary_conductance, \n                  decoupling, \n                  evapotranspiration, \n                  photosynthesis, \n                  max_itererations)\n\nEnergy-balance model composed of submodels from radiation conductance,  boundary conductance, decoupling, evapotranspiration photosynthesis.\n\nmax_itererations determines the maximum number of iterations to perform to determine  flux and temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.enbal!","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.enbal!","text":"enbal!(v, p)\n\nThis subroutine calculates leaf photosynthesis and transpiration.\n\nThese may be calculated by: (1) assuming leaf temperature = air temperature, cs = ca and ds = da (2) using iterative scheme of Leuning et al (1995) (PCE 18:1183-1200) to calculate leaf temp, CsCa.\n\nSetting maxiterations = 0 gives (1); maxiterations > 0 (suggest 100) gives (2).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.enbal_init!","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.enbal_init!","text":"model_init!(v, f)\n\nRuns any model initialisation that needs to happen at the start of energy balance\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.enbal_update!","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.enbal_update!","text":"model_update!(v, f, tleaf)\n\nRuns any model specific variable updates that need to happen at the end of the leaf temperature convergene loop\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Model-variables","page":"Home","title":"Model variables","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"BallBerryVars","category":"page"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.BallBerryVars","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.BallBerryVars","text":"BallBerryVars(tair, windspeed, par, rnet, soilmoist, pressure, tleaf, swp, swpshade, vpd, ca, rh,\n              cs, vpdleaf, rhleaf, fheat, gbhu, gbhf, gh, gbh, gv, gradn, lhv, et, slope, decoup,\n              gs_div_a, km, ci, gammastar, gs, gsv, gbv, jmax, vcmax, rd, ac, aleaf, vj, aj, fsoil)\n\nVariables for Ball-Berry stomatal conductance models.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Biophysical-components","page":"Home","title":"Biophysical components","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Photosynthesis.saturated_vapour_pressure\nPhotosynthesis.vapour_pressure_deficit\nPhotosynthesis.latent_heat_water_vapour\nPhotosynthesis.penman_monteith\nPhotosynthesis.arrhenius\nPhotosynthesis.leaftemp","category":"page"},{"location":"#Photosynthesis.saturated_vapour_pressure","page":"Home","title":"Photosynthesis.saturated_vapour_pressure","text":"saturated_vapour_pressure(tair)\n\nCalculate saturated water vapour pressure in u\"Pa\"  at air temperature tair in u\"K\".\n\nFrom Jones 1992 p 110 (note error in a -
